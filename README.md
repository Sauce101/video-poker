# Video Poker API

Open [Video Poker API](https://videopokerapi.netlify.app/) to view it in your browser.

This is a video poker game app that uses Redux Toolkit Query to communicate with an api of playing cards. The name of the site this app communicates with is [https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/) . I use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for frontend tooling with the React library and TypeScript template. I also added [PWA Vite Plugin](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/) to this project to make it a Progressive Web App. Please install the app to your device to enjoy the native standalone version.

To play, just press or click on a card to hold it, then use the Draw button to get the next set of cards. Every time the Deal button is pressed the deck reshuffles and deals.
